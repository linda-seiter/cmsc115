# CMSC 115 Week 1 Programming Projects

## Setup

TODO: ...

## Task 1 - Poem.java

- Edit `Poem.java` to add a JavaDoc comment with your name before the class
  header.

```java
/**
 * Poem class demonstrates printing text to the console.
 * @author First Last
 */

```

- Edit the `main` method to generate a poem with at least 10 lines of output.
  You may create your own poem or use an existing one. Include a title and
  author. Experiment with adding extra white space in between or within the
  lines of the poem. A sample children's poem that uses white space is shown
  below.

```text
    I LIKE STARS

           Blue stars,
        Red stars,
  Green stars,too.

I like purple stars.
How about you?

           Orange stars,
        Pink stars,
  Yellow stars,too.

I like rainbow stars.
How about you?

```

- Run `PoemTest` to confirm your solution passes the Junit test. The test is
  designed to count the number of lines of output.

## Task 2 - BillSplitter.java

Assume 2 people are splitting a restaurant bill for $94.20. Service was good so
add a 20% tip.

- Create a new class named `BillSplitter` in the `week1_project` default
  package.

- Add a JavaDoc comment:

```text
/**
 * BillSplitter class demonstrates printing a math expression.
 * @author First Last
 */
```

- Edit the `main` method to add a single Java statement to **calculate and
  print** the per person share using the following formula:

<img src="images/bill_split.png" width="200">

- Run `BillSplitterTest` to confirm your solution passes the Junit tests. The
  test looks for an expression with addition, multiplication, and division
  operators (in that order).

If your code does not pass the test, recall operator precedence and the default
order of operations:

1. Parentheses
2. Multiplication and Division
3. Addition and Subtraction
