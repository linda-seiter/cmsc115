# CMSC 115 Week 1 Lab

## Learning Objectives

- Run a Java class
- Edit a Java class
- Use single-line and multi-line (block) comments
- Declare, initialize, and update a variable.
- Use numeric operators in calculations.
- Use a `Scanner` to read user input.
- Identify and fix common syntax errors

## Setup

VS Code is a powerful interactive development environment (IDE) whose primary
purpose is to serve as a code editor. The basic user interface includes a
explorer on the left that lists files and folders, and an editor on the right
that displays the content of opened files.

![user interface explorer and editor views](images/vscode_ui.png)

If the explorer view is not displayed, click the top button in the activity
sidebar, or select View > Explorer from the top menu bar.

<img alt="explorer top button in activity sidebar" src="images/explorer_button.png" width="200" >

Expand the `week1_lab > src > main` folders to list the Java files in the
default package:

<img alt="expand week1_lab, src, main folders" src="images/week1_lab.png" width="200" >

## Task 1 - CourseWelcome.java

Click on `CourseWelcome.java` to open the file in the editor window.

![open file from Explorer](images/open_file.png)

A Java class with a `main` method represents an executable program. The `main`
method is automatically called when you run the program.

```java
public class CourseWelcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to CMCS 115.");
        System.out.println("Let's learn Java!");
    }
}
```

There are several ways to run the `main` method.

|                                                                                               | Alternative ways to run `main`                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img alt="click run button above main signature" src="images/run_main.png" width="400" >      | Click `Run` above the main method signature.                |
| <img alt="right-click class, Run Java" src="images/run_java.png" width="400" >                | Right-click on the Java file, then select `Run Java`.       |
| <img alt="Run, Run without Debugging main menubar" src="images/run_menubar.png" width="400" > | Select `Run > Run Without Debugging` from the main menubar. |

VS Code displays the console output in a terminal window, which is usually
located at the bottom of the user interface.
![terminal output](images/terminal_output.png)

Many of the labs you'll do involve writing a program to produce some expected
output. The current code produces the text shown in the "Actual Output" column
below. However, assume the code should produce the text in the "Expected Output"
column.

| Expected Output                                                      | Actual Output                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Welcome to CMCS 115 - Introductory Programming.<br>Let's learn Java! | Welcome to CMCS 115.<br>Let's learn Java! |

When the actual output does not match the expected output, we need to fix the
code:

1. Edit the first statement in the `main` method to print the character string
   "Welcome to CMCS 115 - Introductory Programming.".
2. Save your changes by selecting File > Save from the menu bar, or type Ctrl-S
   (Windows/Linux) or Command-S (Mac).
3. Run `CourseWelcome` and confirm the code produces the expected output.

## Task 2 - Comments.java

Java comments can be used to help explain the code. A comment can also prevent
one or more lines of code from executing.

- Line comment: Text following `//` is ignored.
- Block or multi-line comment: Text between `/*` and `*/` is ignored.

Click on `Comments.java` to open the file in the editor, then run the program to
view the output.

```java
/**
 * Comments class - demonstrate different types of Java comments.
 *
 * @Author first last
 */
public class Comments {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("apple");

        //System.out.println("orange");

        System.out.println("pear");  //End of line comment

        /*
        System.out.println("lemon");
        System.out.println("banana");
         */

        System.out.println("watermelon");

        System.out.println("peach");
    }
}

```

| Expected Output                     | Actual Output                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| apple<br>pear<br>watermelon<br><br> | apple<br>pear<br>watermelon<br>peach |

- A line comment `//` prevents the print statement for "orange" from executing.
- A block comment `/* */` prevents the print statements for "lemon" and "banana"
  from executing.
- The print statement for "pear" executes since `//` is placed _after_ the
  statement.

Notice the expected output does not include "peach". Let's fix the program to
produce the expected output:

1. Add `//` to comment out the last print statement (don't delete it!). Save the
   file.
2. Run `Comments` to confirm the expected output is produced.

Save and close any open files.

### JavaDoc

The `Comments` class contains a special type of block comment before the class
header called a _JavaDoc_ comment. A Javadoc comment has an extra asterisk at
the beginning `/**` and ends with `/`. For example:

```java
/**
 * Comments class demonstrates different types of Java comments.
 *
 * @Author first last
 */
```

JavaDoc is used to generate documentation in HTML format from Java source code.
We'll learn more about JavaDoc in a later lesson, but it is a good idea to
comment each class and method, and use special tags such as `@Author`.

## Task 3 - Fixit.java

Click on `Fixit.java` to open the file in the editor.

```java
public class Fixit {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("ship");
      //System.out.println("airplane")
      System.out.println("tank");
   }
}
```

| Expected Output          | Actual Output        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| ship<br>airplane<br>tank | ship<br>tank<br><br> |

Run the program to view the output. The second print statement is commented out
so the program does not produce the expected output.

1. Remove the comment characters `//` from the second print statement.
2. Notice the editor window displays red warning symbol at the end of the line.
   Hover the mouse over the warning symbol to view the error message. The popup
   window shows a syntax error due to a missing semicolon.<br>
   ![compiler displays warning symbol near syntax error](images/compiler_warning.png)
3. Try to run the program **without** fixing the error. A warning message
   appears indicating the build failed. Click "Continue" to execute the code
   anyway. The program crashes and an error message about the missing semicolon
   is displayed in the terminal window.

Every statement in the `main` method must end with a semicolon. Let's fix the
syntax error so the program can execute.

1. Add a semicolon to the end of the print statement to fix the syntax error.
   Save the file.
2. Run `Fixit` to confirm the expected output.

Close any open files.

## Task 4 - Printing.java

Click on `Printing.java` to open the file in the editor.

```java
public class Printing {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("red ");
        System.out.print("green ");
        System.out.println("blue ");
        System.out.print("pink ");
        System.out.println("yellow");
    }

}
```

- `System.out.println`: Appends a newline character. Subsequent output appears
  on the next line.
- `System.out.print` : Does not append a newline character. Subsequent output
  appears on the same line.

| Expected Output                        | Actual Output                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| red <br>green blue <br>pink <br>yellow | red <br>green blue <br>pink yellow<br><br> |

Run the program to view the output. In the expected output, "yellow" appears on
a separate line from "pink". Let's fix the program to produce the expected
output:

1. Adjust the statement `System.out.print("pink ");` so a newline character is
   appended after printing "pink".
2. Run `Printing` to confirm the expected output.

Save and close any open files.

## Task 5 - MathExpression.java

Click on `MathExpression.java` to open it in the editor.

```java
public class MathExpression {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("2 + 3 * 8 = ");
        System.out.println(2 + 3 * 8);
    }
}
```

A `String` is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes. An unquoted
arithmetic expression evaluates to a numeric value.

| Expression      | Value           |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| "2 + 3 \* 8 = " | "2 + 3 \* 8 = " |
| 2 + 3 \* 8 =    | 26              |

Run `MathExpression` to view the output. Assume we would like to evolve the
program to produce the expected output shown below:

| Expected Output   | Actual Output   |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| (2 + 3) \* 8 = 40 | 2 + 3 \* 8 = 26 |

1. Adjust the 2 print statements to produce the expected output. You need to add
   parenthesis in both the string and the math expression to force `+` to be
   performed before `*`.
2. Run `MathExpression` to confirm the expected output.

Save and close any open files.

## Task 6 - Paycheck.java

Click on `Paycheck.java` to open the file in the editor.

```java
/**
 * Paycheck class - debugging sample to demonstrate variables in memory
 * @author First Last
 */
public class Paycheck {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Declare and initialize variables
		double hourlyRate = 18.25;
		int hoursWorked = 35;
		double pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate;

		//Print initial values
		System.out.println("Week#1 hours: " + hoursWorked + " rate: $" + hourlyRate + " pay: $" + pay);

		//Assign hoursWorked to 39, recalculate pay
		hoursWorked = 39;
		pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate;

		//Print updated values
		System.out.println("Week#2 hours: " + hoursWorked + " rate: $" + hourlyRate + " pay: $" + pay);

		//TODO: Week 3 - Assign hoursWorked to 27, increase hourlyRate by 0.50, recalculate pay

		//TODO: Print updated values

	}
}
```

Execute the program and view the output.

```text
Week#1 hours: 35 rate: $18.25 pay: $638.75
Week#2 hours: 39 rate: $18.25 pay: $711.75
```

- A **variable** is a name associated with a memory location.
- A **variable declaration** allocates memory to store a value.

Each variable declaration must specify a data type such as `int` or `double`,
along with the variable name. Once a variable is declared, it can be assigned an
initial value. The declaration and initialization can be done in one statement
or two as shown below.

| One Statement                                | Two Statements                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int hoursWorked = 35; //declare & initialize | int hoursWorked; &nbsp; &nbsp;//declare<br>hoursWorked = 35; //initialize |

A variable is declared only once within a block such as a method body. However,
it can be assigned a value several times.

Let's use the debugger to step through the program one line of code at a time.

Debugging shows how variables are declared, initialized, and updated in memory.

<table>

<tr>
<td>
<img src = "images/set_breakpoint.png" alt="click in line 9 gutter to set breakpoint" width=300>
</td>
<td>
Set a breakpoint at line 9 by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line number.  A breakpoint is indicated by a small circle.  You can remove a breakpoint by clicking on it again.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src = "images/debug_button.png" alt="debug button on menubar" width=200>
</td>
<td>
There are several ways to start the debugger:<br>
- Click the "Debug" button above the class header. <br>
- Right-click Paycheck.java, then select "Debug Java".<br>
- Select "Run > Start Debugging" from the main menubar.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The main method is called and stops execution at the breakpoint, i.e. line 9. If
the program doesn't stop at line 9, you might not have set the breakpoint.

<img src = "images/debug_perspective.png" alt="debug perspective" width=600>

- Line 9 is highlighted and there is a red arrow in the gutter, indicating the
  current line of execution.
- The **variables view** will display the variables stored in memory for the
  current method.
- The menubar displays new buttons to control the debugging session.

<img src = "images/debug_controls.png" alt="debug perspective" width=300>

Let's use the "Step Over" button to execute one line of code at a time and
observe how each statement impacts the variables stored in memory. The "Step
Over" button is second in the menubar. You can also press F10 to execute the
current line of code.

</table>

Now that you've seen how variables are initialized and updated in memory, update
the `main` method as follows:

- Add statements to update `hoursWorked` and `hourlyRate` and recalculate `pay`
  for week#3.
- Print the updated variable values. The expected output is displayed below:

```text
Week#1 hours: 35 rate: $18.25 pay: $638.75
Week#2 hours: 39 rate: $18.25 pay: $711.75
Week#3 hours: 27 rate: $18.75 pay: $506.25
```

Run `Paycheck` and confirm the expected output. Use the debugger to find and fix
any errors.

Save and close any open files.

NOTE: Aside from visualizing variables in memory, you can use the debugger to
step through your code to find logic errors. Debugging is **one of the most
useful skills** you can develop as a software developer!

## Task 7 - Rectangle.java

Click on `Rectangle.java` to open the file in the editor.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Rectangle class - demonstrate initializing variables from console input
 *
 * @author First Last
 */
public class Rectangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize Scanner for reading input from console
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt for length and width
        System.out.print("Enter length and width: ");

        // Declare width and initialize from the console input
        double length = input.nextDouble();

        // Declare width and initialize from the console input
        double width = input.nextDouble();

        // TODO: Declare area and initialize using width and height

        // TODO: Update to also print area
        System.out.println("length=" + length + " width=" + width);

    }
}
```

The program uses a `Scanner` to read user input and initialize the `length` and
`width` variables of a rectangle.

When you run the `Rectangle` class, the program displays the prompt "Enter
length and width: " and then waits until you enter two double values in the
terminal window.

<img src="images/console_input.png" alt="enter user input in the terminal window">

The program should calculate and print the length, width, and area of the
rectangle. However, it only prints the length and width.

| Expected Input/Output                                                    | Actual Input/Output                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enter length and width: <b>4.5 3.0</b><br>length=4.5 width=3.0 area=13.5 | Enter length and width: <b>4.5 3.0</b><br>length=4.5 width=3.0 |

1. Update the `main` method to declare a variable named `area`. Calculate the
   area using the given width and length. Update the print statement to display
   the length, width, and area as shown in the expected output.
2. Run `Rectangle` several times, passing different input values for length and
   width.

| Sample Run#1                                                             | Sample Run#2                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enter length and width: <b>4.5 3.0</b><br>length=4.5 width=3.0 area=13.5 | Enter length and width: <b>10.25 2.5</b><br>length=10.25 width=2.5 area=25.625 |
